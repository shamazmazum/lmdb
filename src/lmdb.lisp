  for the latest version.")

(defsection @lmdb/introduction (:title "Introduction")
  """[\LMDB](http://www.lmdb.tech/doc/), the Lightning Memory-mapped
  Database, is an [ACID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID) key-value
  database with
  [MVCC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiversion_concurrency_control).
  It is a small C library ("C lmdb" from now on), around which LMDB is
  a Common Lisp wrapper. LMDB covers most of C lmdb's functionality,
  has a simplified API, much needed @LMDB/SAFETY checks, and
  comprehensive documentation.

  Compared to other key-value stores, LMDB's distuingishing features
  are:

  - Transactions span multiple keys.

  - Embedded. It has no server but can be used concurrently not only
    by multiple threads but by multiple OS processes, too.

  - Extremely high read performance: millions of transactions per
    second.

  - Very low maintenance.

  Other notable things:

  - With its default - the most durable - settings, it has average
    write performance, which is bottlenecked by `fsync()`.

  - Readers don't block readers or writers, but there is at most one
    writer at a time.

  - Extremely simple, crash-proof design.

  - The entire database (called *environment*) is backed by a single
    memory-mapped file, with a
    [copy-on-write](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write)
    [B+ tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%2B_tree).

  - No transaction log.

  - It is very much like [Berkeley
    \DB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_DB) done right,
    without the fluff and much improved administration.

  Do read the [Caveats](http://www.lmdb.tech/doc/), though. On the
  Lisp side, this library __will not work with virtual threads__
  because LMDB's write locking is tied to native threads.

  Using LMDB is easy:

  ```
  (with-temporary-env (*env*)
    (let ((db (get-db "test")))
      (with-txn (:write t)
        (put db "k1" #(2 3))
        (print (g3t db "k1")) ; => #(2 3)
        (del db "k1"))))
  ```

  More typically, the environment and databases are opened once so
  that multiple threads and transactions can access them:

  ```
  (defvar *test-db*)

  (unless *env*
    (setq *env* (open-env "/tmp/lmdb-test-env/" :if-does-not-exist :create))
    (setq *test-db* (get-db "test" :value-encoding :utf-8)))

  (with-txn (:write t)
    (put *test-db* 1 "hello")
    (print (g3t *test-db* 1)) ; => "hello"
    (del *test-db* 1))
  ```

  Note how :VALUE-ENCODING sneaked in above. This was so to make G3T
  return a string instead of an octet vector.

  LMDB treats keys and values as opaque byte arrays to be hung on a B+
  tree, and only requires a comparison function to be defined over
  keys. LMDB knows how to serialize the types `(UNSIGNED-BYTE 64)` and
  [STRING][type] (which are often used as keys so sorting must work as
  expected). Serialization of the rest of the datatypes is left to the
  client. See @LMDB/ENCODINGS for more.

(defsection @lmdb/design-and-implementation (:title "Design and implementation")
  (@lmdb/safety section)
  (@lmdb/deviations-from-the-lmdb-api section))

(defsection @lmdb/safety (:title "Safety")
  "The lmdb C API trusts client code to respect its rules. Being C,
  managing object lifetimes is the biggest burden. There are also
  rules that are documented, but not enforced. This Lisp wrapper tries
  to enforce these rules itself and manage object lifetimes in a safe
  way to avoid data corruption. How and what it does is described in
  the following.

  ##### Environments

  - OPEN-ENV checks that the same path is not used in multiple open
    environments to prevent locking issues documented in
    [Caveats](http://www.lmdb.tech/doc/).

  - CLOSE-ENV waits until all @ACTIVE-TRANSACTIONs are finished before
    actually closing the environment. Alternatively, if OPEN-ENV was
    called with :SYNCHRONIZED NIL, to avoid the overhead of
    synchronization, the environment is closed only when garbage
    collected.

  ##### Transactions

  - Checks are made to detect illegal operations on parent
    transactions (see LMDB-ILLEGAL-ACCESS-TO-PARENT-TXN-ERROR).

  - Access to closed transactions is reliably detected.

  - C LMDB allows read transactions to be used in multiple threads.
    The synchronization cost of performing this safely (i.e. without
    risking access to closed and freed transaction objects) is
    significant so this is not supported.

  ##### Databases

  - [mdb_dbi_open()](http://www.lmdb.tech/doc/group__mdb.html#gac08cad5b096925642ca359a6d6f0562a)
    is wrapped by GET-DB in a transaction and is protected by a mutex
    to comply with C lmdb's requirements:

           A transaction that opens a database must finish (either
           commit or abort) before another transaction may open it.
           Multiple concurrent transactions cannot open the same
           database.

  - [mdb_dbi_close()](http://www.lmdb.tech/doc/group__mdb.html#ga52dd98d0c542378370cd6b712ff961b5)
    is too dangerous to be exposed as explained in the GET-DB
    documentation.

  - For similar reasons, DROP-DB is wrapped in WITH-ENV.

  - [mdb_env_set_mapsize()](http://www.lmdb.tech/doc/group__mdb.html#gaa2506ec8dab3d969b0e609cd82e619e5),
    [mdb_env_set_max_readers()](http://www.lmdb.tech/doc/group__mdb.html#gae687966c24b790630be2a41573fe40e2),
    and [mdb_env_set_maxdbs()](http://www.lmdb.tech/doc/group__mdb.html#gaa2fc2f1f37cb1115e733b62cab2fcdbc)
    are only available through OPEN-ENV because they either require that
    there are no write transactions or do not work on open environments.

  ##### Cursors

  - As even read transactions are restricted to a single thread, so
    are cursors. Using a cursor from a thread other than the one in
    which it was created (i.e. the thread of its transaction) raises
    LMDB-CURSOR-THREAD-ERROR. In return for this restriction, access
    to cursors belonging to closed transactions is reliably detected.

  ##### Signal handling

  The C lmdb library handles system calls being interrupted (`EINTR`
  and `EAGAIN`), but unwinding the stack from interrupts in the middle
  of LMDB calls can leave the in-memory data structures such as
  transactions inconsistent. If this happens, their further use risks
  data corruption. For this reason, calls to LMDB are performed with
  interrupts disabled. For SBCL, this means SB-SYS:WITHOUT-INTERRUPTS.
  It is an error when compiling LMDB if an equivalent facility is not
  found in the Lisp implementation. A warning is signalled if no
  substitute is found for SB-SYS:WITH-INTERRUPTS because this makes
  the body of WITH-ENV, WITH-TXN, WITH-CURSOR and similar
  uninterruptible.

  Operations that do not modify the database (G3T, CURSOR-FIRST,
  CURSOR-VALUE, etc) are async unwind safe, and for performance they
  are called without the above provisions.

  Note that the library is not reentrant, so don't call LMDB from
  signal handlers.")

(defsection @lmdb/deviations-from-the-lmdb-api
    (:title "Deviations from the C lmdb API")
  """The following are the most prominent deviations and omissions from
  the C lmdb API in addition to those listed in @LMDB/SAFETY.

  ##### Environments

  - [mdb_reader_list()](http://www.lmdb.tech/doc/group__mdb.html#ga8550000cd0501a44f57ee6dff0188744)
    is not implemented.

  - [mdb_env_copy()](http://www.lmdb.tech/doc/group__mdb.html#ga5d51d6130325f7353db0955dbedbc378)
    and its close kin are not yet implemented.

  ##### Transactions

  - Read-only WITH-TXNs are turned into noops when "nested" (unless
    IGNORE-PARENT).

  ##### Databases

  - [mdb_set_compare()](http://www.lmdb.tech/doc/group__mdb.html#ga68e47ffcf72eceec553c72b1784ee0fe)
    and [mdb_set_dupsort()](http://www.lmdb.tech/doc/group__mdb.html#gacef4ec3dab0bbd9bc978b73c19c879ae)
    are not exposed. If they are needed, implement a foreign comparison
    function and call LIBLMDB:SET-COMPARE or LIBLMDB:SET-DUPSORT
    directly or perhaps change the encoding of the data.

  - Working with multiple contiguous values with DUPFIXED is not yet
    implemented. This functionality would belong in PUT, CURSOR-PUT,
    CURSOR-NEXT and CURSOR-VALUE.

  - PUT, CURSOR-PUT do not support the
    [`\\RESERVE`](http://www.lmdb.tech/doc/group__mdb__put.html#gac0545c6aea719991e3eae6ccc686efcc)

  "Create an ENV object through which the LMDB environment can be
  accessed and open it. To prevent corruption, an error is signalled
  if the same data file is opened multiple times. However, the checks
  performed do not work on remote filesystems (see ENV-PATH).

  LMDB-ERROR is signalled if opening the environment fails for any
  other reason.

  Unless explicitly noted, none of the arguments persist (i.e. they
  are not saved in the data file).

  PATH is the filesystem location of the environment files (see SUBDIR
  below for more). Do not use LMDB data files on remote filesystems,
  even between processes on the same host. This breaks `flock()` on
  some OSes, possibly memory map sync, and certainly sync between
  programs on different hosts.

  IF-DOES-NOT-EXIST determines what happens if ENV-PATH does not
  exists:

  - :ERROR: An error is signalled.

  - :CREATE: A new memory-mapped file is created ensuring that all
    containing directories exist.

  - `NIL`: Return NIL without doing anything.

  See CLOSE-ENV for the description of SYNCHRONIZED.

  - MAX-DBS: The maximum number of named databases in the environment.
    Currently a moderate number is cheap, but a huge number gets
    expensive: 7-120 words per transaction, and every GET-DB does a
    linear search of the opened database.

  - MAP-SIZE: Specifies the size of the data file in bytes. The new
    size takes effect immediately for the current process, but will
    not be persisted to any others until a write transaction has been
    committed by the current process. Also, only map size increases
    are persisted into the environment. If the map size is increased
    by another process, and data has grown beyond the range of the
    current mapsize, starting a new transaction (see WITH-TXN) will
    signal LMDB-MAP-RESIZED-ERROR. If zero is specified for MAP-SIZE,
    then the persisted size is used from the data file. Also see
    LMDB-MAP-FULL-ERROR.

  - MODE: Unix file mode for files created. The default is `#o664`.
    Has no effect when opening an existing environment.

  The rest of the arguments correspond to LMDB environment flags and
  are available in the plist ENV-FLAGS.

  - SUBDIR: If SUBDIR, then the path is a directory which holds the
    `data.mdb` and the `lock.mdb` files. If SUBDIR is NIL, the path
    is the filename of the data file and the lock file has the same
    name plus a `-lock` suffix.

  - SYNC: If NIL, don't `fsync` after commit. This optimization means
    a system crash can corrupt the database or lose the last
    transactions if buffers are not yet flushed to disk. The risk is
    governed by how often the system flushes dirty buffers to disk and
    how often SYNC-ENV is called. However, if the filesystem preserves
    write order (very few do) and the WRITE-MAP (currently
    unsupported) flag is not used, transactions exhibit
    ACI (atomicity, consistency, isolation) properties and only lose
    D (durability). I.e. database integrity is maintained, but a
    system crash may undo the final transactions.

  - META-SYNC: If NIL, flush system buffers to disk only once per
    transaction, but omit the metadata flush. Defer that until the
    system flushes files to disk, the next commit of a non-read-only
    transaction or SYNC-ENV. This optimization maintains database
    integrity, but a system crash may undo the last committed
    transaction. I.e. it preserves the ACI (atomicity, consistency,
    isolation) but not D (durability) database property.

  - READ-ONLY: Map the data file in read-only mode. It is an error to
    try to modify anything in it.

  - TLS: Setting it to NIL allows each OS thread to have multiple
    read-only transactions (see WITH-TXN's IGNORE-PARENT argument). It
    also allows and transactions not to be tied to a single thread,
    but that's quite dangerous, see @LMDB/SAFETY.

  - READ-AHEAD: Turn off readahead as in `madvise(MADV_RANDOM)`. Most
    operating systems perform read-ahead on read requests by default.
    This option turns it off if the OS supports it. Turning it off may
    help random read performance when the DB is larger than RAM and
    system RAM is full. This option is not implemented on Windows.

  - LOCK: Data corruption lurks here. If NIL, don't do any locking. If
    concurrent access is anticipated, the caller must manage all
    concurrency itself. For proper operation the caller must enforce
    single-writer semantics, and must ensure that no readers are using
    old transactions while a writer is active. The simplest approach
    is to use an exclusive lock so that no readers may be active at
    all when a writer begins.

  - MEM-INIT: If NIL, don't initialize `malloc`ed memory before
    writing to unused spaces in the data file. By default, memory for
    pages written to the data file is obtained using `malloc`. While
    these pages may be reused in subsequent transactions, freshly
    `malloc`ed pages will be initialized to zeroes before use. This
    avoids persisting leftover data from other code (that used the
    heap and subsequently freed the memory) into the data file. Note
    that many other system libraries may allocate and free memory from
    the heap for arbitrary uses. E.g., stdio may use the heap for file
    I/O buffers. This initialization step has a modest performance
    cost so some applications may want to disable it using this flag.
    This option can be a problem for applications which handle
    sensitive data like passwords, and it makes memory checkers like
    Valgrind noisy. This flag is not needed with WRITE-MAP, which
    writes directly to the mmap instead of using malloc for pages.

  - FIXED-MAP (experimental): This flag must be specified when
    creating the environment and is stored persistently in the data
    file. If successful, the memory map will always reside at the same
    virtual address and pointers used to reference data items in the
    database will be constant across multiple invocations. This option
    may not always work, depending on how the operating system has
    allocated memory to shared libraries and other uses.

  Unsupported flags (an error is signalled if they are changed from
  their default values):

  - WRITE-MAP: Use a writable memory map unless READ-ONLY is set. This
    is faster and uses fewer mallocs, but loses protection from
    application bugs like wild pointer writes and other bad updates
    into the database. Incompatible with nested transactions. This may
    be slightly faster for DBs that fit entirely in RAM, but is slower
    for DBs larger than RAM. Do not mix processes with and without
    WRITE-MAP on the same environment. This can defeat
    durability (SYNC-ENV, etc).

  - MAP-ASYNC: When using WRITE-MAP, use asynchronous flushes to disk.
    As with SYNC NIL, a system crash can then corrupt the database or
    lose the last transactions. Calling #sync ensures on-disk database
    integrity until next commit.

  Open environments have a finalizer attached to them that takes care
  of freeing foreign resources. Thus, the common idiom:

  ```
  (setq *env* (open-env \"some-path\"))
  ```

  is okay for development, too. No need to always do WITH-ENV,
  which does not mesh with threads anyway.

  Since accessing @LMDB/TRANSACTIONS, @LMDB/DATABASES and

  curruption, CLOSE-ENV makes sure that they are not in use. There are
  two ways this can happen:

  - If ENV was opened :SYNCHRONIZED (see OPEN-ENV), then CLOSE-ENV
    waits until there are no @ACTIVE-TRANSACTIONs in ENV before
    closing it. This requires synchronization and introduces some
    overhead, which might be noticable for workloads involving lots of
    quick read transactions. It is an LMDB-ERROR to attempt to close
    an environment in a WITH-TXN to avoid deadlocks.

  - On the other hand, if SYNCHRONIZED was NIL, then - unless FORCE is
    true - calling CLOSE-ENV signals an LMDB-ERROR to avoid the
    @LMDB/SAFETY issues involved in closing the environment.
    Environments opened with :SYNCHRONIZED NIL are only closed when
    they are garbage collected and their finalizer is run. Still, for
    production it might be worth it to gain the last bit of
    performance.

  Write transactions can be nested. Child transactions see the

  Transactions provide ACID guarantees (with SYNC and META-SYNC both

  - If WRITE is NIL, the transaction is read-only and no writes (e.g.
    PUT) may be performed in the transaction. On the flipside, many
    read-only transactions can run concurrently (see ENV-MAX-READERS),
    while write transactions are mutually exclusive. Furthermore, the
    single write transaction can also run concurrently with read
    transactions, just keep in mind that read transactions hold on to
    the state of the environment at the time of their creation and
    thus prevent pages since replaced from being reused.

  - If IGNORE-PARENT is true, then in an enclosing WITH-TXN, instead
    of creating a child transaction, start an independent transaction.

  - If SYNC is NIL, then no flushing of buffers will take place after
    a commit as if the environment had been opened with :SYNC NIL.

  - Likewise, META-SYNC is the per-transaction equivalent of the
    OPEN-ENV's META-SYNC.

(defsection @lmdb/nesting-transactions (:title "Nesting transactions")
  """When WITH-TXNs are nested (i.e. one is executed in the dynamic
  extent of another), we speak of nested transactions. Transaction can
  be nested to arbitrary levels. Child transactions may be committed
  or aborted independently from their parent transaction (the
  immediately enclosing WITH-TXN). Committing a child transaction only
  makes the updates made by it visible to the parent. If the parent
  then aborts, the child's updates are aborted too. If the parent
  commits, all child transactions that were not aborted are committed,
  too.

  Actually, the C lmdb library only supports nesting write
  transactions. To simplify usage, the Lisp side turns read-only
  WITH-TXNs nested in another WITH-TXNs into noops.

  ```
  (with-temporary-env (*env*)
    (let ((db (get-db "test" :value-encoding :uint64)))
      ;; Create a top-level write transaction.
      (with-txn (:write t)
        (put db "p" 0)
        ;; First child transaction
        (with-txn (:write t)
          ;; Writes of the parent are visible in children.
          (assert (= (g3t db "p") 0))
          (put db "c1" 1))
        ;; Parent sees what the child committed (but it's not visible to
        ;; unrelated transactions).
        (assert (= (g3t db "c1") 1))
        ;; Second child transaction
        (with-txn (:write t)
          ;; Sees writes from the parent that came from the first child.
          (assert (= (g3t db "c1") 1))
          (put db "c1" 2)
          (put db "c2" 2)
          (abort-txn)))

      (with-txn ()
        ;; Since the second child aborted, its writes are discarded.
        (assert (= (g3t db "p") 0))
        (assert (= (g3t db "c1") 1))
        (assert (null (g3t db "c2"))))))
  ```

  COMMIT-TXN, ABORT-TXN, and RESET-TXN all close the
  @ACTIVE-TRANSACTION (see OPEN-TXN-P). When the active transaction is
  not open, database operations such as G3T, PUT, DEL signal
  LMDB-BAD-TXN-ERROR. Furthermore, any @LMDB/CURSORS created in the
  context of the transaction will no longer be valid (but see
  CURSOR-RENEW).

  An LMDB parent transaction and its cursors must not issue operations
  other than COMMIT-TXN and ABORT-TXN while there are active child
  transactions. As the Lisp side does not expose transaction objects
  directly, performing @LMDB/BASIC-OPERATIONS in the parent
  transaction is not possible, but it is possible with @LMDB/CURSORS
  as they are tied to the transaction in which they were created.

  IGNORE-PARENT true overrides the default nesting semantics of
  WITH-TXN and creates a new top-level transaction, which is not a
  child of the enclosing WITH-TXN.

  - Since LMDB is single-writer, on nesting an IGNORE-PARENT write
    transaction in another write transaction, LMDB-BAD-TXN-ERROR is
    signalled to avoid the deadlock.

  - Nesting a read-only WITH-TXN with IGNORE-PARENT in another
    read-only WITH-TXN is LMDB-BAD-RSLOT-ERROR error with the TLS
    option because it would create two read-only transactions in the
    same thread.

  Nesting a read transaction in another transaction would be an
  LMDB-BAD-RSLOT-ERROR according to the C lmdb library, but a
  read-only WITH-TXN with IGNORE-PARENT NIL nested in another WITH-TXN
  is turned into a noop so this edge case is papered over.

    returning values. This is the encoding used for INTEGER-KEY and
    INTEGER-DUP DBs.

  - :OCTETS: Note the plural. Data to be encoded (e.g. KEY argument of
    G3T) must be a 1D byte array. If its element type
    is `(UNSIGNED-BYTE 8)`, then the data can be passed to the foreign
    code more efficiently, but declaring the element type is not

  - :UTF-8: Data to be encoded must be a string, which is converted to
    octets by TRIVIAL-UTF-8. Null-terminated. Foreign byte arrays are
    decoded the same way.

  - NIL: Data is encoded using the default encoding according to its
    Lisp type: strings as :UTF-8, vectors as :OCTETS, `(UNSIGNED-BYTE

  - A [CONS][type]: Data is encoded by the function in the CAR of the

  The following flags are for database creation, they do not have any
  effect in subsequent calls (except for the
  @LMDB/THE-UNNAMED-DATABASE).

  - INTEGER-KEY: Keys in the database are C `unsigned` or `size_t`
    integers encoded in native byte order. Keys must all be either
    `unsigned` or `size_t`, they cannot be mixed in a single database.

  - REVERSE-KEY: Keys are strings to be compared in reverse order,
    from the end of the strings to the beginning. By default, keys are
    treated as strings and compared from beginning to end.

  - DUPSORT: Duplicate keys may be used in the database (or, from
    another perspective, keys may have multiple values, stored in
    sorted order). By default, keys must be unique and may have only a
    single value. Also, see @DUPSORT.

  - INTEGER-DUP: This option specifies that duplicate data items are
    binary integers, similarly to INTEGER-KEY. Only matters if
    DUPSORT.

  - REVERSE-DUP: This option specifies that duplicate data items
    should be compared as strings in reverse order. Only matters if
    DUPSORT.

  - DUPFIXED: This flag may only be used in combination DUPSORT. When
    true, data items for this database must all be the same size,

    this (e.g. PUT, CURSOR-PUT, CURSOR-NEXT and CURSOR-VALUE), do not.

  No function to close a database (an equivalent to
  [mdb_dbi_close()](http://www.lmdb.tech/doc/group__mdb.html#ga52dd98d0c542378370cd6b712ff961b5))
  is provided due to subtle races and corruption it could cause when
  an `MDB_dbi` (unsigned integer, similar to an fd) is assigned by a
  subsequent open to another named database.

(defsection @lmdb/encodings (:title "Encoding and decoding data")
  """In the C lmdb library, keys and values are opaque byte vectors
  only ever inspected internally to maintain the sort order (of keys
  and also duplicate values if @DUPSORT). The client is given the
  freedom and the responsibility to choose how to perform conversion
  to and from byte vectors.

  LMDB exposes this full flexibility while at the same time providing
  reasonable defaults for the common cases. In particular, with the
  KEY-ENCODING and VALUE-ENCODING arguments of GET-DB, the
  data (meaning the key or value here) encoding can be declared
  explicitly.

  Even if the encoding is undeclared, it is recommended to use a
  single type for keys (and duplicate values) to avoid unexpected
  conflicts that could arise, for example, when the UTF-8 encoding of
  a string and the :UINT64 encoding of an integer coincide. The same
  consideration doubly applies to named databases, which share the key
  space with normal key-value pairs in the default database (see
  @LMDB/THE-UNNAMED-DATABASE).

  Together, :UINT64 and :UTF-8 cover the common cases for keys. They
  trade off dynamic typing for easy sortability (using the default C
  lmdb behaviour). On the other hand, when sorting is not
  concern (either for keys and values), serialization may be done more
  freely. For this purpose, using an encoding of :OCTETS or NIL with
  [cl-conspack](https://github.com/conspack/cl-conspack) is
  recommended because it works with complex objects, it encodes object
  types, it is fast and space-efficient, has a stable specification
  and an alternative implementation in C. For example:

  ```
  (with-temporary-env (*env*)
    (let ((db (get-db "test")))
      (with-txn (:write t)
        (put db "key1" (cpk:encode (list :some "stuff" 42)))
        (cpk:decode (g3t db "key1")))))
  => (:SOME "stuff" 42)
  ```

  Note that multiple DB objects with different encodings can be
  associated with the same C lmdb database, which declutters the code:

  ```
  (defvar *cpk-encoding*
    (cons #'cpk:encode (alexandria:compose #'cpk:decode #'mdb-val-to-octets)))

  (with-temporary-env (*env*)
    (let ((next-id-db (get-db "test" :key-encoding *cpk-encoding*
                                     :value-encoding :uint64))
          (db (get-db "test" :key-encoding *cpk-encoding*
                             :value-encoding *cpk-encoding*)))
      (with-txn (:write t)
        (let ((id (or (g3t next-id-db :next-id) 0)))
          (put next-id-db :next-id (1+ id))
          (put db id (list :some "stuff" 42))

    of finding KEY's location in the B+ tree by performing
